Despite a strong start and early success, KIND Karz is facing a significant decline in product quality, particularly with airbag failures, brake issues, and other critical components. In the last year alone, customer complaints, warranty claims, and costly recalls have increased sharply, resulting in a 25% drop in net profit and an equivalent drop in stock value. Supplier-related delays and capacity issues—especially from the airbag assembly partner—have further compounded the issue, leading to missed delivery deadlines and lost sales opportunities.

While the manufacturing plants operate under an adapted Toyota Production System, key suppliers and vendors do not, creating inconsistencies in quality and production planning. With growing safety concerns, legal liabilities, and plummeting customer satisfaction, there is an urgent need to identify root causes of defects, reduce quality variation, and improve supplier reliability to restore KIND Karz's brand image and operational excellence.
