The goal of this Six Sigma project is to reduce the number of airbag-related failures and recalls in KIND Karz vehicles by at least 50% over the next 6 months, while also improving supplier responsiveness and delivery reliability. This will be achieved by identifying root causes of airbag defects, optimizing assembly and inspection processes at the supplierâ€™s end, and implementing quality improvement measures.
The project aims to:
- Improve airbag quality and reduce defects leading to recalls and warranty claims.
- Ensure supplier lead time reduction and better demand planning.
- Improve customer safety and restore brand reputation.
- Positively impact net profit and stock performance by lowering operational costs and increasing customer satisfaction.

This project will use the DMAIC methodology and will be completed by a cross-functional team within 9 months, led by the Operational Excellence team.
